# Project Title: Enhanced Air Quality Modeling with Physics-Informed Neural Networks

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the implementation of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) integrated with ConvLSTM architectures for the prediction of air pollutant dispersion using meteorological data and the advection-diffusion equation. The project aims to improve the accuracy and stability of environmental models, offering a significant advancement in air quality forecasting.

## Features
- **Physics-Informed Neural Networks:** Utilizes PINNs to ensure the model adheres to physical laws.
- **ConvLSTM Architectures:** Leverages ConvLSTM for capturing spatial-temporal dynamics in environmental data.
- **Model Comparison:** Compares the performance of PINNs against traditional statistical learning models.
- **Data Visualization:** Includes plots and graphs to illustrate model performance and data analysis.
