# Project Title: Enhanced-Air-Quality-Modeling-with-Physics-Informed-Neural-Networks
## Overview
This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the implementation of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) integrated with ConvLSTM architectures for the prediction of air pollutant dispersion using meteorological data and the advection-diffusion equation. The project aims to improve the accuracy and stability of environmental models, offering a significant advancement in air quality forecasting.
## Features
Physics-Informed Neural Networks: Utilizes PINNs to ensure the model adheres to physical laws.
ConvLSTM Architectures: Leverages ConvLSTM for capturing spatial-temporal dynamics in environmental data.
Model Comparison: Compares the performance of PINNs against traditional statistical learning models.
Data Visualization: Includes plots and graphs to illustrate model performance and data analysis.
